# Airbnb Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing the MongoDB Atlas sample Airbnb dataset. The goal is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), perform data cleaning, and visually represent the findings using Power BI.

## Problem Statement
The project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, and use geospatial visualizations and dynamic plots to uncover insights related to pricing, availability, and location-based trends.

## Objective
The primary objective is to leverage data visualization techniques to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Airbnb dataset. This involves using EDA and Business Intelligence tools, such as Power BI, to visually interpret the data and extract meaningful insights.

## Libraries
The following libraries and modules are required for this project:
- Pandas
- urllib.parse
- pymongo

## Data Visualization Tool
**Power BI**: The main tool used for creating data visualizations and reports. It connects to various data sources and allows users to create interactive visualizations using a drag-and-drop interface.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Data Extraction
Establish a connection to the MongoDB Atlas database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset.

### Step 2: Data Cleaning
Clean the dataset by addressing missing values, eliminating duplicates, and adjusting data types as required. Ensure data integrity and consistency throughout the process.

### Step 3: Data Analysis
Utilize the cleaned data to analyze price variations across different locations, property types, and seasons. Develop dynamic plots and charts to explore trends in pricing, identify outliers, and discern correlations with other variables.

### Step 4: Data Visualization
Use Tableau to create a comprehensive dashboard showcasing key insights from the analysis. Integrate various visualizations, including maps, charts, and tables, to provide a holistic view of the Airbnb dataset and its underlying patterns.

### Step 5: Final Output
The final output aims to provide an easily accessible analysis of Airbnb data for clients and users, particularly those interested in tourism and hotel visits. This includes features such as hotel types, average prices, minimum and maximum prices, types of rooms, available facilities, and a map for convenient exploration.

## Installation
