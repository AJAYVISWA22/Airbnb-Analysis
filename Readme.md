Project Overview
In this project, which involves the MongoDB Atlas sample Airbnb dataset, our objective is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by performing data cleaning. Ultimately, we aim to represent the insightful findings in a visually compelling format through storytelling using Power BI.

Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, conduct data cleaning and preparation, and utilize geospatial visualizations and dynamic plots to uncover insights related to pricing, availability, and location-based trends.

Objective
The project's objective is to use Airbnb data visualization techniques for a comprehensive understanding of the dataset. It aims to leverage Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Intelligence tools, such as Power BI, to visually interpret the data and extract meaningful insights.

Libraries
Modules needed for the project:

pandas
urllib.parse
pymongo
Data Visualization Tool
Power BI: The main product for creating data visualizations and reports. It is a Windows desktop application that can connect to a variety of data sources and allows users to create interactive visualizations using a drag-and-drop interface.

Workflow
Step 1: Establish Connection
Establish a connection to the MongoDB Atlas database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset.

Step 2: Data Cleaning
Clean the Airbnb dataset by addressing missing values, eliminating duplicates, and adjusting data types as required. Prepare the dataset for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization tasks, ensuring data integrity and consistency throughout the process.

Step 3: Data Analysis and Visualization
Utilize the cleaned data to conduct an analysis and visualization of price variations across different locations, property types, and seasons. Develop dynamic plots and charts that empower users to explore trends in pricing, identify outliers, and discern correlations with other variables.

Step 4: Dashboard Creation
Leverage Power BI to craft a comprehensive dashboard showcasing key insights derived from your analysis. Integrate various visualizations, including maps, charts, and tables, to offer a holistic perspective on the Airbnb dataset and its underlying patterns. Employ analysis techniques such as DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create new measures and add columns, enhancing the utility and depth of your analysis. This approach will enable a more nuanced exploration of the dataset, facilitating a richer understanding of trends and relationships within the Airbnb data.

Step 5: Final Output
The final output of the project aims to provide an easily accessible analysis of Airbnb data for clients and users, particularly those interested in tourism and hotel visits. This analysis includes features such as hotel types, average prices, minimum and maximum prices, types of rooms, available facilities, and a map for convenient exploration. By presenting this information in a user-friendly format, we aim to enhance the experience of individuals seeking accommodation, offering valuable insights into various aspects of Airbnb listings to facilitate informed decision-making for their travel plans.

Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/airbnb-analysis.git
cd airbnb-analysis
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have Power BI installed if you wish to use it for additional visualizations.

Usage
To start the analysis and visualization process, follow the steps in the workflow section. For Power BI visualizations, import the cleaned data into Power BI and create your dashboards and reports.
